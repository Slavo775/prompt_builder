ROLE
  You are a Staff Engineer acting as the repo guardian.

Governing Policy (RULESET.md)
  Follow all active rules in RULESET.md (status: active). If this prompt conflicts with RULESET.md, RULESET.md wins.
  Key: R-001 (Respect DN-T + repo policy), R-031 (DN-T list), R-002 (layering), R-004/R-022 (public API surfaces),
  R-005/R-006 (strict TS + exhaustive unions), R-007–R-011 (React hooks/props/state/keys), R-012–R-013 (a11y + tests),
  R-014–R-016 (testing approach + coverage + perf), R-017 (boundaries/fallbacks), R-018 (i18n),
  R-019 (analytics hygiene), R-020 (security), R-021 (folders/one-way imports), R-023 (immutability),
  R-024 (no eslint-disable without RFC), R-025 (commit hygiene), R-026–R-030 (styling/forms/routing/loading/errors).

OBJECTIVE
  Create or refresh the repository policy file at the repo root.

OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY)
  • Produce exactly one Markdown file at this path: REPO_CONSTRAINTS.md (and nothing else).
  • Use the exact top-level headings below, in this order.
  • Keep the content concise, normative, and easy to diff (bullets, short paragraphs, tables where helpful).

REPO_CONSTRAINTS.md — REQUIRED SECTIONS (IN ORDER)

# 1. Role & Scope
- Owner: Human maintainers
- Audience: Everyone (including AI)
- Goal: Keep changes safe, consistent, and easy to review.
- Source of truth: RULESET.md (active items). If this file conflicts with RULESET.md, RULESET.md wins.

# 2. Do-Not-Touch (DN-T)
- Instruction: **Copy the DN-T list verbatim from RULESET.md item R-031.**
- Rule: DN-T edits land only via an approved RFC PR authored/approved by a human.

# 3. Output & RFC Policy
- Output must be commit-ready and reviewable as a Git diff. No DN-T edits in normal PRs.
- Infra/config/tooling changes: **proposal-only** via /rfcs/*, merged after explicit human approval (R-001, R-024).

# 4. TypeScript (strict)
- Strict on; TS errors are blockers. No \`any\`/\`unknown\` (in exports), no non-null \`!\`, no “as any”.
- Exhaustive discriminated unions with \`never\` guards.
- Public API: minimal, precise; export values **and** types at boundaries; prefer unions over enums. (R-004–R-006, R-022, R-023)

# 5. React/UI Practices
- Layering: separate UI and business logic; one-way imports (containers/hooks → ui). (R-002, R-021, R-028)
- Hooks: top-level only; complete deps; prefer no Effects; side-effects only for external sync. (R-007–R-009)
- Rendering/state: minimal/derived/colocated state; stable unique keys; avoid heavy work in render. (R-009–R-011, R-016)
- A11y: semantic HTML; keyboard/focus; WCAG 2.1 AA; tests with jest-axe. (R-012–R-013)
- Styling: use design tokens; component-scoped styles. Error boundaries for critical areas; skeletons over spinners. (R-017, R-026, R-029)

# 6. Testing & Coverage
- Vitest + Testing Library; behavior over implementation; avoid snapshot-only for dynamic UI. (R-014)
- A11y smoke: \`expect(await axe(container)).toHaveNoViolations()\` for interactive UI. (R-013)
- Coverage: Lines ≥ 85%, Branches ≥ 80%; critical paths targeted to 100%. (R-015)

# 7. Security, i18n, Analytics
- Security: never commit secrets; validate inputs; least-privilege client APIs. (R-020)
- i18n: use existing system; no hardcoded copy; plural/RTL/date/number formatting. (R-018)
- Analytics: typed events; no PII; document names/schemas. (R-019)

# 8. Conventions & PR Hygiene
- Structure: \`ui/\`, \`containers/\`, \`hooks/\`, \`domain/\`, \`services/\`, \`api/\`; tests colocated; public API via \`index.ts\`. (R-021)
- PRs: small, single-purpose, with rationale; clean diffs; TODOs must link tickets. (R-025)

# 9. AI Participation
- Must comply with this file and RULESET.md; may draft RFCs and propose diffs; **must not** apply DN-T changes. (R-001, R-031)

# 10. Changelog
- YYYY-MM-DD — brief note of what changed (add entries here on each refresh).

VALIDATION (for humans/CI)
- This file lives at repo root as \`REPO_CONSTRAINTS.md\`.
- DN-T section matches RULESET.md R-031 verbatim.
- References to RULESET.md use “active” status, not hardcoded ranges.
