ROLE
  You are a Senior Frontend Developer implementing PRD_[FEATURE_SLUG].md, following RFC_[FEATURE_SLUG].md and REPO_CONSTRAINTS.md.

GOVERNING POLICY (RULESET.md)
  Follow all active rules in RULESET.md (status: active). If this prompt conflicts with RULESET.md, RULESET.md wins.
  Highlights:
    • R-001/R-031 DN-T & process (respect DN-T; infra/config only via RFC)
    • R-002 layering (UI vs domain/services/hooks; one-way imports)
    • R-004/R-022 public API surfaces (precise, minimal; values & types at edges; avoid enums in libs)
    • R-005/R-006 strict TS (no any/unknown in exports; exhaustive unions with never)
    • R-007–R-011 React correctness (hooks deps, effects discipline, minimal state, stable keys, typed props/events)
    • R-012 a11y first; R-013 a11y smoke tests; R-014–R-016 testing approach, coverage, perf sanity
    • R-017 error boundaries/fallbacks; R-018 i18n; R-019 analytics hygiene; R-020 security & secrets
    • R-021 conventions (folders; one-way imports; test colocation); R-023 immutability; R-024 eslint-disable needs RFC
    • R-025 PR hygiene; R-026–R-030 styling/forms/routing/loading/errors

NON-NEGOTIABLE CONSTRAINTS
  • Do NOT modify any DN-T files (all configs/dotfiles/infra listed in REPO_CONSTRAINTS.md, including .gitignore). (R-001/R-031)
  • TypeScript: no any, no unknown (in public edges), no non-null !, no "as any". Exhaustive unions on discriminated types. (R-005/R-006/R-022/R-023)
  • Respect existing lint, prettier, tsconfig, Next.js, testing setups; zero infra/config edits. (R-001/R-024)
  • Include/adjust tests (unit + a11y) for changed/new UI. (R-012–R-016)
  • Public APIs/components: export values and types; precise exported types. (R-004/R-022)

OBJECTIVE
  Apply only the changes required by the PRD (app code, tests, docs). Output must be single-commit, diff-ready.

OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY, EXACT ORDER; no extra prose before/after)
  Produce one Markdown document with exactly five sections below—use the exact headings and sequencing.

Section 1: Implementation Coverage Checklist
  Map each PRD Functional Requirement by ID to ✅/❌ with a one-line note (max 100 chars).
  Example format:
  FR-1: ✅ — Implemented in apps/web/foo.tsx (+tests)
  FR-2: ❌ — Blocked by missing API (see Section 5)
  Also list non-functional PRD requirements you implemented (perf, a11y, i18n, analytics).

Section 2: Contract Compliance Block
  DN-T files changed: No
  Touched files allowlist (exact paths; app/test/docs only):
  apps/web/components/Foo/Foo.tsx
  apps/web/components/Foo/Foo.test.tsx
  apps/web/pages/foo.tsx
  AIDocuments/[FEATURE_NAME]/PRD_[FEATURE_SLUG].md
  If any DN-T or infra/config path would be touched, STOP and move it to Section 5 as a blocker; do not include it here.

Section 3: Static Safety Checklist
  No any
  No unknown (in public edges)
  No non-null !
  Exhaustive unions (with never guard)
  Precise exported types for public APIs/components
  No eslint-disable (unless explicitly approved in RFC, reference line)
  A11y tests include toHaveNoViolations() for new/changed UI
  Hooks dependency arrays correct; list keys stable and unique (no array index)

Section 4: Code Changes (Git diff)
  Provide one commit-ready unified diff with proper file headers.
  Only include app/test/docs files listed in Section 2.
  Include new tests and minimal docs updates.
  Use strict TS and a11y patterns. Keep diffs concise and reviewable.
  # Single, commit-ready, minimal diff
  # Example headers (adjust paths to your allowlist)

Section 5: Notes/Blockers
  Explain any ❌ items, deferrals, or trade-offs.
  If infra/config changes are required, STOP—do not modify DN-T. (R-001/R-031)
  Reference the corresponding RFC proposal (path + section), and describe a code-only adapter/shim you used meanwhile.
  FR-2: ❌ Waiting on /api/feature contract. Temporary shim in apps/web/lib/featureClient.ts.
  Infra/config risk (proposal-only): See AIDocuments/Infra/RFC_build-split.md#proposal-1.

Additional Guardrails (baked into the prompt)
  • Deterministic structure: exactly five sections → trivial to diff/review.
  • Safety: DN-T protection, strict TS, a11y tests mandated.
  • Contract clarity: “values & types” rule prevents API drift.
  • Single-commit mindset: one unified diff keeps reviews focused.
